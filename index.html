			<h3>A Nexus of Indexes</h3>
			<h4>Abstract</h4>
			<p>
				The large memories available for read-optimized databases have changed the landscape of index creation and exploitation.
				Instead of complex data structures aimed at fast concurrent OLTP updates, modern column stores rely on fast scans over
				(sorted) partitions and/or the use of partial indices. In this talk we will present two such indexes, namely imprints
				and secondary projections. These indexes are designed to alleviate the storage duplication caused by complex primary
				indexes and support a compact representation of intermediates in the order required for the remainder of the query
				execution plan. We will also present our vision for a nexus of indexes, where an index is not a stand-alone structure
				inside a database engine, but part of a series of connections linking two or more indexes. Finally, we will discuss
				future work on hardware-driven index design that extends across the three layers of shared-memory programming.

			<h3>A Database System with Amnesia</h3>
			<h4>Abstract</h4>
			<p>
				Big Data comes with huge challenges. Its volume and velocity makes handling, curating, and analytical processing a
				costly affair. Even to simply “look at” the data within an a priori defined budget and with a guaranteed interactive
				response time frame might be impossible. Scale-out approaches will hit the technology and monetary wall soon,
				if not done so already. Blindly dumping data when the channel is full, or reducing the data resolution at the source,
				might lead to loss of valuable observations. An army of well-educated database administrators or full software
				stack architects might deal with the challenges, but a seemingly knobless DBMS is to be preferred. A fundamental change
				in database management is called for. One approach, called data rotting, has been proposed as an alternative solution.
				For the sake of storage management and responsiveness, it lets the DBMS semi-autonomously rot away data. Rotting is based
				on the systems own unwillingness to keep old data as easily accessible as fresh data. Our work sheds more light on the
				opportunities and potential impacts of this radical departure in data management. Specifically, we study the case where
				a DBMS selectively forgets tuples (by marking them inactive) under various amnesia scenarios and with different implementation
				strategies. Our final aim is to use the findings of this study to morph an existing data management engine to serve demanding
				big data scientific applications with well-chosen data amnesia algorithms.

			<h3>Bits are Valuable: making a Frugal Database Kernel</h3>
			<h4>Abstract</h4>
			<p>
				In this talk, we are going to iterate over a collection of indexes
				on the making. Each index serves a different query scenario, but
				they all have one common design principal. They use just a few
				bits to decide if a large piece of data needs to be fetched from
				storage. Transferring data costs, thus each bit that encodes
				information to avoid unnecessary data transfer is valuable.
				A frugal database kernel leaves no bits behind.
				To give one example, we introduce column imprint, a simple but efficient
				cache conscious secondary index. A column imprint is a collection of
				many small bit vectors, each indexing the data points of a single
				cacheline. Next, we will talk about Splited Bloom filters. In this
				scenario, instead of using a single large Bloom filter, we split it
				into multiple smaller Bloom filters, each one covering a separate subset
				of tuples. This makes it possible to adjust the size of the filters
				and use more bits for subsets that are larger and/or more frequently
				accessed. Finally, we will present future ideas on how multiple bloom
				filters can be used to implement unary and binary database operators that
				work over extra large data sets.

			<h3>Column Imprints: A Secondary Index Structure</h3>
			<h4>Abstract</h4>
			<p>
			Large scale data warehouses rely heavily on secondary indexes,
			such as bitmaps and b-trees, to limit access to slow IO devices.
			However, with the advent of large main memory systems, cache
			conscious secondary indexes are needed to improve also the transfer
			bandwidth between memory and cpu. In this presentation, we introduce
			column imprint, a simple but efficient cache conscious secondary index.
			A column imprint is a collection of many small bit
			vectors, each indexing the data points of a single cacheline. An
			imprint is used during query evaluation to limit data access and
			thus minimize memory traffic. The compression for imprints is
			cpu friendly and exploits the empirical observation that data often
			exhibits local clustering or partial ordering as a side-effect of the
			construction process. Most importantly, column imprint compression remains
			effective and robust even in the case of unclustered data, while other
			state-of-the-art solutions fail. We conducted an
			extensive experimental evaluation to assess the applicability and
			the performance impact of the column imprints. The storage over-
			head, when experimenting with real world datasets, is just a few
			percent over the size of the columns being indexed. The evaluation
			time for over 40000 range queries of varying selectivity revealed
			the efficiency of the proposed index compared to zonemaps and
			bitmaps with WAH compression.

			<h3>SciBORQ: Scientific data management with Bounds On Runtime and Quality</h3>
			<h4>Abstract</h4>
			<p>
				Data warehouses underlying virtual observatories stress the capabilities of
				database management systems in many ways. They are filled on a daily basis with
				large amounts of factual information, derived from intensive data scrubbing
				and computational feature extraction pipelines. Querying these huge databases
				require a sizable computing cluster, while ideally the initial investigation
				should run interactively on as little resources as possible.
			</p>
			<p>
				In this talk, we will explore a different route, based on the observation that
				at any given time only a fraction of the data is of primary value for a
				specific task. This fraction becomes the focus of scientific reflection through
				an iterative process of ad-hoc query refinement. We will present SciBORQ, a
				framework for scientific data exploration that allows precise control over the
				runtime and the quality of query answering. Novel techniques are presented to
				derive multiple interesting data samples, called impressions. An impression is
				selected such that the statistical error of a query answer remains low, while
				the result can be computed within strict time bounds. Impressions differ from
				previous sampling approaches in their bias towards the focal point of the
				scientific data exploration, their multi-layer design, and their adaptiveness
				to shifting query workload.
